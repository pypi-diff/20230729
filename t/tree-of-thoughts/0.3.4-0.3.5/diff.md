 3. Create a state evaluator function V(pŒ∏, S) with two strategies:
    a. Value each state independently.
    b. Vote across states.
 4. Choose a search algorithm (BFS or DFS) based on the tree structure.
 5. Implement the chosen search algorithm.
 6. Execute the chosen search algorithm with the input problem, thought generator, state evaluator, and other required parameters.

 ## Usage Examples
 
 ### OpenAI API
 
 To use Tree of Thoughts with OpenAI's API, create a custom model class that inherits from `AbstractLanguageModel` and implements the required methods using OpenAI's API. Then, create an instance of the `TreeOfThoughts` class with the custom model and the desired search algorithm ('BFS' or 'DFS').

-# Roadmap:
-
-* Resilient Prompting: Teach model how to think rather than what to think.
-
-* Add pruning treshold management for precise bad state cutoff
-
-* Evaluating each thought as soon as thought generated then evaluating an chain of thoughts or the state of thoughts by averaging out the values of each thought evaluation.
-
-* Add Traversal method, which "will incapsulate the run of either dfs or bfs under the hood so that the issue of different args is solved from @ivanzhovannik

 # Search Algorithms in Tree of Thoughts 
 
 The Tree of Thoughts library supports a variety of search algorithms that can be employed for different problem-solving contexts. Here's a brief overview of each search algorithm along with their primary benefits and use-cases.
 
 ## 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
@@ -353,12 +328,77 @@
 The branching factor of the search tree, which determines the maximum number of child nodes for each parent node.
 A higher value of b allows the algorithm to explore more states, potentially leading to better solutions. However, increasing b may also increase the computational complexity and time required to find a solution.
 
 ## value_threshold (float, default=0.5): 
 The value threshold for pruning states. 
 States with a value below this threshold will be discarded, reducing the search space. A higher value of vth will result in a more aggressive pruning strategy, potentially speeding up the search process. However, setting vth too high may cause the algorithm to discard promising states, leading to suboptimal solutions.
 
+
+## LangchainTOT class
+
+`LangchainTOT` is the main class you'll interact with. It acts as a wrapper for the Large Language Model and allows you to set a problem description, add thoughts, and check the validity of these thoughts using a specified checker.
+
+### Initialization
+
+You initialize a `LangchainTOT` object with an optional problem description and a checker class:
+
+```python
+problem_description = """
+3,*,*,2|1,*,3,*|*,1,*,3|4,*,*,1
+- This is a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle.
+- The * represents a cell to be filled.
+- The | character separates rows.
+- At each step, replace one or more * with digits 1-4.
+- There must be no duplicate digits in any row, column or 2x2 subgrid.
+- Keep the known digits from previous valid thoughts in place.
+- Each thought can be a partial or the final solution.
+""".strip()
+
+langchain_tot = LangchainTOT(problem_description=problem_description, checker_class=lambda: my_checker)
+```
+
+If you want to change the problem description or checker class later, you can use the `set_problem_description` and `set_checker_class` methods.
+
+### Adding thoughts
+
+Once you have your `LangchainTOT` object, you can add thoughts to it. A thought is a string representing a possible solution or step towards a solution. You can add thoughts using the `add_thought` method:
+
+```python
+langchain_tot.add_thought("3,*,*,2|1,*,3,*|*,1,*,3|4,*,*,1")
+```
+
+### Checking thoughts
+
+Once you've added one or more thoughts, you can check their validity using the `check_thoughts` method:
+
+```python
+print(langchain_tot.check_thoughts())
+```
+
+This method will return a `ThoughtValidity` value representing whether the latest thought is a final valid solution (`VALID_FINAL`), an intermediate valid step (`VALID_INTERMEDIATE`), or invalid (`INVALID`).
+
+## MyChecker class
+
+`MyChecker` is a class for creating custom checkers. It inherits from `ToTChecker` and must implement the `evaluate` method.
+
+### Initialization
+
+You initialize a `MyChecker` object with a validation function:
+
+```python
+my_checker = MyChecker(validate_fn=lambda p, t: validate_sudoku(p, t, sudoku_solution))
+```
+
+## Custom validation function
+
+The validation function is a callable that takes a problem description and a tuple of thoughts and returns a `ThoughtValidity` value. It defines how to check the validity of thoughts for a specific problem.
+
+In this code, we're using the `validate_sudoku` function as our validation function. This function takes a problem description, a tuple of thoughts, and a solution string, and returns the validity of the last thought based on whether it matches the solution and whether it's a possible step towards the solution.
+
+The `validate_sudoku` function is specific to 4x4 Sudoku puzzles and you'll need to create your own validation function for different types of problems.
